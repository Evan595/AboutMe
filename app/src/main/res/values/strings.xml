        Hi, my name is Evan. I love fish.
        The kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
        Fun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
        I like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
        And sometimes I even go fishing... and smell like fish :).
        And even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
        Once, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
        I will be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
        You should ask someone else about fishing, though.
